        <h1> Brief of the project</h1>
    <p>The brief for this project was to create a concept that could attract people to a local area. I chose La Florida, a commune in Santiago, Chile, which is currently facing an environmental crisis, with over 150 hectares of pre-Andean forest destroyed in the past decade.</p>
  <p>For this reason, I focused on Cerro Panul, the last native hill and forest in Santiago, which attracts numerous visitors every year, primarily for outdoor activities such as mountain biking and hiking.</p>
<p>Targeting a younger audience, I developed the concept for Pannul’s Beer — an eco-friendly product designed to appeal to university students and encourage them to engage with the area, especially since there are few universities nearby. Another important aspect of the project was to raise awareness and help reduce the ongoing loss of green spaces in the region.</p>

        <h1> Logo</h1>
        <p>The logo is a visual representation of Cerro Panul, featuring text arranged in a rainbow shape to symbolize the various benefits this product brings to the natural environment. The chosen font style conveys a handcrafted, artistic, and creative vibe, reflecting the project's focus on local identity and environmental consciousness.</p>

            <h1> App Design</h1>
            <p> An app was developed to track users' daily steps, allowing them to accumulate points based on their physical activity. These points can be donated to support environmental causes, such as the reforestation of Cerro Panul, or redeemed for discounts on future purchases, creating both personal and community-driven incentives.</p>

                <h1> Final Result</h1>
                <p>This product captures the essence and identity of La Florida, creating a strong sense of belonging and connection within the local community. By attracting university students to the area, it revitalizes the local demographic and encourages interaction between students and residents. Additionally, the focus on reforestation plays a key role in preserving the environment, with 50% of the sales profits allocated to the reforestation of Cerro Panul.</p>
