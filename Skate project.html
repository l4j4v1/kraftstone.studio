        <h1> Project Development Process</h1>
        <p>This project was developed over a period of eight weeks. During the first week, I focused on defining the topic, which explored the marginalization and exclusion of women and non-binary individuals within the skateboarding community, as well as the lack of support for these groups. The research question guiding this project was: How can I use app design, motion, and social networks to connect women and non-binary people to skate?</p>
<p> I then formulated hypotheses and conducted experiments, gathering insights from various sources and personal interviews. After analyzing this research, I began developing initial sketches and concepts to shape the project effectively.</p>
<p> The outcome was a prototype app designed to create a safe and inclusive space for women and non-binary skaters across New Zealand. The goal was to foster a sense of belonging, encourage users to organize meetups at skateparks, and share experiences, knowledge, and support. Additionally, I produced a promotional video to present and promote the app concept.</p>
<h1> Logo</h1>
<p>For the app logo, I aimed for a simple and easily recognizable design that would be accessible to users encountering the app for the first time. I chose a minimalist approach, using clean lines to form the silhouette of a woman skating, reflecting the essence of the community the app represents.</p>

      <h1>App Design</h1>
      <p>For the app, I selected a bold orange as the primary color, paired with black to create strong visual contrast. I then designed the layout and structure of the app to ensure intuitive navigation while providing all the necessary tools to foster effective communication between users and help connect people with similar interests. Below is the prototype developed during the project.</p>

            <h1>Final Result</h1>
            <p>This project not only contributes to increasing the visibility and participation of women and non-binary individuals in skateboarding, but also demonstrates how digital tools can foster inclusive communities across other sports and fields. The app represents a step towards breaking down gender barriers that have historically limited access to skateboarding, creating a more supportive and welcoming space for all skaters.</p>
